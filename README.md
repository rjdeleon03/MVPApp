# About the App
QuikData is an app developed to speed up reporting of disaster-related information such as needs and impact assessments for disaster-stricken communities in the Philippines.

The app runs on any Android phone with at least OS version 5.0.0 (Lollipop) installed. It is
recommended, though, to run the app on devices with Marshmallow or later iterations of the
Android OS.
The Android app is installed via an Application Package Kit (APK) file. The file must be saved in
the target device. The user simply taps or opens the file to install the app. Installation can take a
few minutes.
